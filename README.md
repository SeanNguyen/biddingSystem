# Bidding System
In this I tried to explain the easiest way to setup the environment to run a local server.
The frontend was using nodejs packages to maintain.
The server backend was PHP server.




##Setup local server:
- Install easyPHP: http://www.easyphp.org/easyphp-devserver.php
- Run easyPHP
- Access control panel of easyPHP via 127.0.0.1:8080/home/index.php
- Create allias lead to the "app" folder in the repo
- Access the localhost/"name of the allias you make above"
- Use myPhpAdmin in the admin panel to control and observe the mySql database




##Server configuration:
- database port: 3306
  - database username: root
  - databse password: null (empty space - '')
- web port: 80
